# TEVM Compiler

Rust-backed tooling that exposes Foundry's Solidity/Yul/Vyper compiler stack to JavaScript runtimes via N-API bindings. The active Nx project lives in `libs/compiler/`.

## Start Here

- Read [`libs/compiler/README.md`](libs/compiler/README.md) for setup instructions, build/test commands, API examples, and troubleshooting notes.
- Share [`libs/compiler/build/llms.md`](libs/compiler/build/llms.md) with your preferred LLM, which includes a bundle of docs, types, and specs, and ask it how to implement your feature.

Everything else in the repository exists to support the `@tevm/compiler` package surfaced there.
